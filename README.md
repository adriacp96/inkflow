# InkFlow

InkFlow is your single-page finance companion with a calm, monochrome look.

## What you can do
- **Pick a month/year** to see that period’s cards, recurring bills, spending chart, and calendar heat map all refresh together.
- **Add or edit cards** just by typing a name, choosing a currency, and picking the day they charge. The preview shows their logo, balance, minimum payment, and the currency badge so you can quickly scan what’s due.
- **Track fixed bills** with categories, currency, due day, and optional non-monthly schedules. The list groups bills by category and echoes the same badge/visual style as cards.
- **Visualize cash flow** through the horizontal bars and the calendar to understand how much you need to pay each day.

## How to start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (or host it on a simple static server).
2. Type in your cards and fixed bills—use the “✎ Edit” button to tweak values or days.
3. Tap any day on the calendar for a quick breakdown of what is due.

## Extras
- The page saves everything automatically when your Supabase credentials are configured.
- Logos for known brands live in the `assets/` folder, so matching names show their icon beside the entry.

Launch it on GitHub Pages by publishing from `main` with the repo root as the source, then visit `https://adriacp96.github.io/inkflow/`.
